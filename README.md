Microblogging today has become a very popular communication tool among Internet users. Millions of messages are appearing daily in popular web-sites that provide services for microblogging such as Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook. Authors of those messages write about their life, share opinions on variety of topics and discuss current issues. Because of a free format of messages and an easy accessibility
of microblogging platforms, Internet users tend to shift from traditional communication tools (such as traditional blogs or mailing lists) to microblogging services. As more and more users post about products and services they use, or express their political and religious views, microblogging web-sites become valuable sources of peopleâ€™s opinions and sentiments. Such data can be efficiently used
for marketing or social studies.[1]

##  1  Introduction

###  1.1 Applications of  Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis finds its application in a variety of domains.

**Business**
     Businesses may use sentiment analysis on blogs, review websites etc. to judge the market response of a product. This information may also be used for intelligent placement of advertisements. For example, if product "A" and "B" are competitors and an online merchant business "M" sells both, then "M" may advertise for "A" if the user displays positive sentiments towards "A", its brand or related products, or "B" if they display negative sentiments towards "A". 
     
**Financial Markets**
     Public opinion regarding companies can be used to predict performance of their stocks in the financial markets. If people have a positive opinion about a product that a company A has launched, then the share prices of A are likely to go higher and vice versa. Public opinion can be used as an additional feature in existing models that try to predict market performances based on historical data. 

**Government**
     Governments and politicians can actively monitor public sentiments as a response to their current policies, speeches made during campaigns etc. This will help them make create better public awareness regarding policies and even drive campaigns intelligently.

### 1.2 Twitter 
## Usage

- Extract the fc-7 image features using:
```
python extract_fc7.py --split=train
python extract_fc7.py --split=val
```

- <b>Training</b>
  * Basic usage `python train.py`
  * Options
    - `rnn_size`: Size of LSTM internal state. Default is 512.
    - `num_lstm_layers`: Number of layers in LSTM
    - `embedding_size`: Size of word embeddings. Default is 512.
    - `learning_rate`: Learning rate. Default is 0.001.
    - `batch_size`: Batch size. Default is 200.
    - `epochs`: Number of full passes through the training data. Default is 50.
    - `img_dropout`:  Dropout for image embedding nn. Probability of dropping input. Default is 0.5.
    - `word_emb_dropout`: Dropout for word embeddings. Default is 0.5.
    - `data_dir`: Directory containing the data h5 files. Default is `Data/`.

- <b>Prediction</b>
  * ```python predict.py --image_path="sample_image.jpg" --question="What is the color of the animal shown?" --model_path = "Data/Models/model2.ckpt"```
  * Models are saved during training after each of the complete training data in ```Data/Models```. Supply the path of the trained model in ```model_path``` option.
  
- <b>Evaluation</b>
  * run `python evaluate.py` with the same options as that in train.py, if not the defaults.

## Implementation Details
- fc7 relu layer features from the pretrained VGG-16 model are used for image embeddings. I did not scale these features, and am not sure if that can make a difference.
- Questions are zero padded for fixed length questions, so that batch training may be used. Questions are represented as word indices of a question word vocabulary built during pre processing.
- Answers are mapped to 1000 word vocabulary, covering 87% answers across training and validation datasets.
- The LSTM+VIS model is defined in vis_lstm.py. The input tensors for training are fc7 features, Questions(Word indices upto 22 words), Answers(one hot encoding vector of size 1000). The model depicted in the figure is implemented with 2 LSTM layers by default(num_layers in configurable).

## Results
The model achieved an accuray of 50.8% on the validation dataset after 12 epochs of training across the entire training dataset.

## Sample Predictions

The fun part! Try it for yourself. Make sure you have tensorflow installed. Download the data files/trained model from [this link][9] and save them in the ```Data/``` directory. Also download the [pretrained VGG-16 model][7] and save it as ```Data/vgg16.tfmodel```. You can test for any sample image using:
```
python predict.py --image_path="Data/sample.jpg" --question="Which animal is this?" --model_path="Data/model2.ckpt"
```
